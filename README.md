# 🎙️ AI Voice Chatbot with Gemini API

This project was **entirely created with AI assistance** using generative tools (like ChatGPT and Gemini).  
It demonstrates how to build a **voice-based chatbot** that listens, understands, and speaks back using Google’s Gemini API.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 **Voice Input** – Speak naturally, and the bot listens and transcribes your speech using SpeechRecognition.  
- 🤖 **Gemini Integration** – Generates smart and conversational responses with Google’s Gemini API.  
- 🔊 **Voice Output** – Speaks back responses using pyttsx3 text-to-speech.  
- 🛑 **Exit Command** – Say `"Quit!"` to stop the conversation gracefully.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Listens through your microphone (via PyAudio).  
2. Converts speech to text (SpeechRecognition).  
3. Sends the text prompt to **Gemini API** for response.  
4. Uses **pyttsx3** to speak the reply aloud.
